# Setback (SB)—the distance the jaws of a brake must be setback from the mold line to form a bend. In a 90° bend, SB = R + T (radius of the bend plus thickness of the metal). The setback point is the distance from the apex back to where the bend line is going to be, where the end of our bend goes into the flange
# Calculate Bend Allowance 1Obtain the properties of the bend (bend radius, angle, and method used).Obtain the characteristics of your material (thickness and K-factor for this specific bend). Input everything into the bend allowance formula: BA = angle × (π/180) × (radius + K-factor × thickness) .
# For instance, in this article we have used the following for outside setback: OSSB = [Tangent (degree of bend angle/2)] × (Material thickness + Inside radius). However, some may use another formula: OSSB = (Material thickness + Inside radius) / [Tangent (degree of bend angle/2)].
# Bend Allowance and Bend Deduction
# By experimentation with actual bends in metals, aircraft engineers have found that accurate bending results could be obtained by using the following formula for any degree of bend from 1 to 180: (0.0173 x R + 0.0078 x T) Where R = the desired bend radius, x  N  =  BA. T = the thickness of the material, and N = the number of degrees of bend. Refer to the NA 01-1A-1 for the appropriate
